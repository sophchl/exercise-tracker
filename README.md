# exercise-tracker

A shiny app that allows to enter data on exercise and visualizes the result.

The data is stored locally in a SQLite database and will hence be available whenever the app in launched again on the same device.

Work in progress.

To launch app: 
- The first time
  - download files and remove the current database with the example data
  - run create_datanbase.R to create a new database

- Every time the app is used
  - run helters_rsqlite.R to get the helper function in the environment
  - enter exercise data in the sidebar panel and submit
